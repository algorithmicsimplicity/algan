Shaders
=======

In rendering pipelines, the *shader* is responsible for determining
how the brightness and color of objects changes when light is cast on them.

.. important::

    Currently shaders are only implemented for 3-D objects! 2-D objects
    do not interact with lighting.

By default, Algan will use the :func:`.basic_pbr_shader` function to shade Mobs.
This function implements a simplified physics-based rendering shader, which uses
the metallicness and smoothness of the surface of an object to compute diffuse
and specular lighting. :attr:`~.Mob.metallicness` and :attr:`~.Mob.smoothness`
are also animatable attributes of class :class:`~.Mob`, by default they are both
set to 0.5. You can change these values to get different lighting effects.

You can also write your own shader program. Just write a function with
the same signature as :func:`.basic_pbr_shader`. You can then use
:meth:`~.Mob.set_shader` with your function as the argument to set individual mobs
to use your custom shader.
