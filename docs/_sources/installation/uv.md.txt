# Installing Algan locally

The standard way of installing Algan is by using
Python's package manager `pip` to install the latest
release from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/algan/).

To make it easier for you to follow best practices when it
comes to setting up a Python project for your Algan animations,
we strongly recommend using a tool for managing Python environments
and dependencies. In particular,
[we strongly recommend using `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#getting-started).

For the main way of installing Algan described below, we assume
that `uv` is available; we think it is particularly helpful if you are
new to Python or programming in general. It is not a hard requirement
whatsoever; if you know what you are doing you can just use `pip` to
install Algan directly.

One way to install `uv` is via the dedicated console installer supporting
all large operating systems. Simply paste the following snippet into
your terminal / PowerShell -- or
[consult `uv`'s documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#getting-started)
for alternative ways to install the tool.

## Installation

### Step 1: Installing Python

We first need to check that an appropriate version of Python is available
on your machine. Open a terminal to run
```bash
uv python install
```
to install the latest version of Python. If this is successful, continue
to the next step.

### Step 2 (optional): Installing LaTeX

[LaTeX](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) is a very well-known
and widely used typesetting system allowing you to write formulas like

\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\gamma} \frac{f(z)}{(z - z_0)^{n+1}}~dz
= \frac{f^{(n)}(z_0)}{n!}.
\end{equation*}

If rendering plain text is sufficient for your needs and you don't want
to render any typeset formulas, you can technically skip this step. Otherwise
select your operating system from the tab list below and follow the instructions.

:::::{tab-set}

::::{tab-item} Windows
For Windows we recommend installing LaTeX via the
[MiKTeX distribution](https://miktex.org). Simply grab
the Windows installer available from their download page,
<https://miktex.org/download> and run it.
::::

::::{tab-item} MacOS
If you are running MacOS, we recommend installing the
[MacTeX distribution](https://www.tug.org/mactex/). The latest
available PKG file can be downloaded from
<https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html>.
Get it and follow the standard installation procedure.
::::

::::{tab-item} Linux
Given the large number of Linux distributions with different ways
of installing packages, we cannot give detailed instructions for
all package managers.

In general we recommend to install a *TeX Live* distribution
(<https://www.tug.org/texlive/>). For most Linux distributions,
TeX Live has already been packaged such that it can be installed
easily with your system package manager. Search the internet and
your usual OS resources for detailed instructions.

For example, on Debian-based systems with the package manager `apt`,
a full TeX Live distribution can be installed by running
```bash
sudo apt install texlive-full
```
For Fedora (managed via `dnf`), the corresponding command is
```bash
sudo dnf install texlive-scheme-full
```
As soon as LaTeX is installed, continue with actually installing Algan
itself.

You are welcome to use a smaller, more customizable LaTeX distribution like
[TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/). Algan overall requires the following
LaTeX packages to be installed in your distribution:

```

### Step 3: Installing Pytorch

The first thing we will do is create a new project using uv. Copy-paste
the following commands into your terminal.

```bash
uv init alganimations
cd alganimations
uv venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
```

This creates a new virtual environment where all of our packages will be installed to.

Algan is built on top of Pytorch, to provide GPU accelerated animations and rendering.
Depending on your operating system and GPU hardware, you will need to install different
versions of Pytorch.

Head over to [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and 
to find the instructions for installing Pytorch.

* For the Pytorch build select `Stable`.

* Select your operating system.

* For the package select `pip`.

* For the language select `Python`.

* For the compute platform, you need to select the right version for your
 computer's GPU hardware. If you are using an NVIDIA GPU you want to select
 the latest version of CUDA. If you are using an AMD GPU you will want to
 select ROCm. Otherwise, select CPU.

In the "Run this command" box there should now be a line of text, something like

"pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128".

Copy-paste the command from the Pytorch website, change pip3 to pip, and prepend uv to it.
Now run this command (with uv prepended) in your terminal.
e.g.
```bash
uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

Once uv has finished installing Pytorch, you can check that it was
successful by running this in your terminal

```bash
python -c "import torch; print('Success!')"
```

Finally, we need to install the torch-scatter extension package.
Take this command

uv pip install torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.7.0+{CUDA}.html

and replace {CUDA} with the version of CUDA you installed previously, either cpu, cu118, cu126, or cu128.
Then run it in your terminal.

e.g.

```bash
uv pip install torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.7.0+cu128.html
```

Finally, check that installation was successful with this

```bash
python -c "import torch_scatter; print('Success!')"
```

### Step 4: Installing Algan

Once Pytorch with torch-scatter has successfully been installed,
you can proceed to install Algan by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
uv pip install --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ algan --index-strategy unsafe-best-match
```

If it works with no errors, then you are ready to Alganimate!

At this point, you can also open your project folder with the
IDE of your choice. All modern Python IDEs (for example VS Code
with the Python extension, or PyCharm) should automatically detect
the local environment created by `uv` such that if you put
```py
import algan
```
into a new file `my-first-animation.py`, the import is resolved
correctly and autocompletion is available.

*Happy Alganimating!*
