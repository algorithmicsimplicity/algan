class Group(Mob):
    r"""Combine a collection of Mobs into a single Mob.

    Specifically, creates an empty mob at the mid-point of the bounding box of the
    given mob collection and adds the mobs as children.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mobs : Iterable[ :class:`~.Mob` ]
        The collection of mobs to group.
    *args, **kwargs
        Passed to :class:`~.Mob` .

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`~.Group`
        The new mob which parents the provided mob collection.

    Examples
    --------
    Arrange 3 mobs horizontally in a line, left to right.
